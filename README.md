## 👋 Hey there, I'm Shobhit Sharma (aka SlayeR)

**Lead Frontend & Full Stack Developer | Web3 & Infrastructure Builder**

I'm a developer with 3+ years of experience architecting and shipping high-performance web applications at scale. I specialize in building complex, data-heavy interfaces and modular infrastructure. I'm passionate about clean UIs, low-latency data visualizations, and writing code that stands the test of production. 

Currently, I lead frontend development at **Airchains**, focusing on Web3 infrastructure, appchain tooling, and rollups. I am always open to discussing system architecture, open-source protocols, and interesting technical challenges.

### 🚀 What I Build

Instead of just writing UI components, I focus on the underlying architecture and performance. Some highlights of my work include:

* **High-Performance Dashboards:** Developed a Global Trading System (GTS) interface handling live market data with sub-100ms latency requirements using optimistic UI updates, and crypto analytic dashboards tracking 100+ assets via WebSocket streams.
* **Web3 Infrastructure:** Architected real-time block explorers for custom appchains processing thousands of live events per minute, and designed resilient cross-chain bridge portals.
* **Decentralized Apps:** Built full frontend architectures for AMM-based Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) and scalable NFT marketplace storefronts leveraging IPFS.
* **Conversational AI:** Integrated context-aware LLM APIs into production interfaces with streaming responses and persistent memory.

### 🤓 Beyond the Screen

When I'm not optimizing Core Web Vitals or debugging WebSockets, you can find me diving into my off-screen hobbies:
* 📚 **Book Collector:** I have a curated library of over 150 novels.
* ♠️ **Card Enthusiast:** I passionately collect unique playing cards.
* 🧠 **Tech Philosophy:** I'm a big advocate for privacy tech, homomorphic encryption, and open protocols.
